* Send an NTP packet and wait for the response, return the Unix time
*
* To lower the memory footprint, no buffers are allocated for sending
* and receiving the NTP packets.  Four bytes of memory are allocated
* for transmision, the rest is random garbage collected from the data
* memory segment, and the received packet is read one byte at a time.
* The Unix time is returned, that is, seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00.
